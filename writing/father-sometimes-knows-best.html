      <h2>father (sometimes) knows best</h2>
      <p class="prose">
        My family is congregated around our marble kitchen island, and my dad is refusing to take a DNA test. He’s a tiny bit upset because my mom, my brother, and I all succumbed to curiosity by shelling out $100 each (as well as our saliva, souls, and secrets) to 23andMe, fully expecting to hear that we’re 100% purebred Chinese. It turns out that my mom is an impressive 99% Chinese and my brother and I around 80%. This means that if we’re truly my father’s children, he’s only 60% Chinese.
        My dad is a stout man, slightly tall for being “Chinese,” slightly short for being a “man” (quotation marks because of the social construct that is gender, not because he identifies as 60% man. Although, he once said, “When I was young, I was a girl.”) My dad has a round face, rounder cheeks, shamelessly crooked teeth, and, always, a gently whitening goatee. He has worn a series of glasses that, throughout the years, have been accidentally stepped on and snapped by me and subsequently replaced by more and more modern-looking frames. His complexion is slightly darker than that of an average Chinese, and his hair slightly lighter. I have a Mexican friend who thought my dad was Mexican and a Native friend who thought he was Native. If racial appearance can be objective, my dad is objectively racially ambiguous.
        “Those tests aren’t accurate,” my dad says after learning our DNA results. We’re curious to see where this non-Chinese-ness comes from.
        “I’m going to steal some of your saliva and send it to 23andMe,” I threaten, laughing. Because I am the epitome of Caring Daughter.
        “No,” he says.
        During a road trip over winter break a couple years ago, one of the few times that my family is all together, we stop at a rose garden in Portland, Oregon. Walking through this garden in the mountains, we relish in the greenery that thrives in Oregon but not at home in California. My brother, wearing his permanent outfit of an L.L. Bean jacket, sweatpants, and tennis shoes, stares at a rose, head tilted with analytic curiosity, while my mom studies his face.
        “Who do you look like?” she wonders aloud, “You don’t look like anybody.”
        “Think about it hard,” my dad says to her, jokingly stern. I start laughing.

        When I am around 7, in one of my earliest memories of learning about ethnic stereotypes, my family dines at an Italian restaurant called “Pasta?” My dad taught my brother and me to call it “Pasta question mark” because he doesn’t like to have fun. We’ve finished eating, paid, and my dad is waiting to get his credit card back. The waiter loiters around us and asks, “Are you waiting on anything more?”
        My dad opens his mouth, pauses, and says in what I now understand to be a mocking, Italian accent, “Where is my ~Veeesah?” Everyone laughs, and they sound like they’re cackling because I don’t understand what’s so funny. My dad smirks a little while looking down, in what I now recognize to be his self-contained amusement at his own jokes, whether or not his audience appreciates it. At that moment, however, I’m impressed that my dad is apparently funny.

        My dad loves us so much, he’s desperately needy about it. When I’m in high school, he tries brainwashing me into attending a local university, fantasizing, “You can live at home if you go to UC Berkeley.” Every college student’s dream. When COVID-19 spreads during my first year at Brown (located a heartbreaking 3,000 miles away from home), my dad is inappropriately elated at how much time he can now spend with family. I shelter-in-place at home for the whole summer. “Don’t go back,” he keeps telling me, as I plan my escape back to the East Coast for fall semester. “Stay home. Just stay home,” he says in a resigned murmur.

        My father epitomizes the loving trope of immigrant parents who cut fruit for their children. My best friend, after witnessing my dad knock on my door and silently hand me bowls of cut apples, oranges, or strawberries over the course of seven years, concludes beautifully, “Your dad’s love language is preparing fruit for you.”
        When I am six years old, I sit in the family minivan, still parked in the garage but getting ready to drive somewhere, anywhere. My dad peels tangerines for my brother and me. He stands in front of us, holding two halves in his open palm. He starts to reach out to hand us the tangerines but then pauses, smiling mischievously. He separates one slice from each half, says, “Tax,” and pops them in his capitalist mouth. He places the remaining, smaller clusters into our confused, outstretched hands.

        My dad is a registered Republican who has voted for Democratic presidents since he became a U.S. citizen. His membership with the Good Old Party primarily has to do with being pro-life. During senior year of high school, I learn that my mom, upon finding out she was pregnant with me, wanted to get an abortion. My dad, pro-life and dreaming of having four kids (son, daughter, son, daughter, in that order) asked his religious coworkers of various beliefs to pray for his wife to carry the child. As a result, here I am, confirming that religion is real.
        I learn I am the product of a consciously pro-life decision, yet I could never see myself having those same political beliefs. Upset and confused at my upset, I ask my dad, “What would you do if I got pregnant right now? At sixteen.” He remains silent, looking down.
        “Would you want me to have it?” I continue.
        “Don’t ask me that kind of question,” he murmurs.

        Since immigrating to the US from China, my dad has sought to fulfill his version of the American Dream: owning a house with an Eden-level garden. Throughout my childhood, my mom grows unsatisfied with our apartment or house or studio and makes us move every one-and-a-half years. It’s easy to see the good in a new location or building until you live there long enough for the charms to turn into annoyances. My dad patiently goes along with her changes of heart, as he relishes attending open houses and walking through potential new residences, hoping to make his garden dream come true. And so, I spend many a childhood Sunday putting on soft blue fabric shoe coverings to happily shuffle through manicured houses. We don’t realize it then, but I suspect my dad was biding his time, waiting for my mom to tire us out and bring us to the brink of refusing to move again. At this point, he unveils to us the current family estate: a single-story house with a devastatingly beautiful garden. Why single-story? “So when I’m old and I retire, I don’t have to climb stairs and can still live here.” What a genius. “I want my ashes to be buried under that tree,” he adds peacefully, pointing to the back corner of the garden. Noted.
        He buys a manual lawnmower and spends his weekends collecting armfuls of cut grass to put into our compost bin.
        One day, after living in this house for a year, I drive home with my dad when I spot an open house sign in our neighborhood. “Do you want to visit?” I ask, perhaps simply for the sake of nostalgia.
        “No,” my dad replies simply.
        “No?” Is he depressed?
        “No, I already peaked.”

        When I am in eighth grade, I start thinking about shaving my body hair, about the expectation for women to only show the softness of bare skin. I ask my mom, who doesn’t start shaving until I do, to buy me a razor I picked out after extensive research, and she says, “I’ll think about it.” That night, my dad comes into my room when I’m about to go to bed. My mom “thinking about it” means talking to my dad.
        “Why do you want to shave?”
        “I don’t know,” I say, embarrassed.
        “Don’t do it.”
        “Why not?” I ask.
        “It’s natural. Just leave it. It’s natural the way it is.”
        I don’t. I can’t leave it the way it is. It’s only when I get to college that I begin wishing I listened to my dad when I was in middle school.
        
        People often say mothers know best, but my father is not without his own wisdom.
