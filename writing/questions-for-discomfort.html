      <h2>questions for discomfort</h2>
      <p class="poetry">
        how much more of a woman do i become
        the first time i pull a trigger in a bodycon dress
          
        how long can we stay best friends
        until i forget my favorite color is our laugh
          
        when will the feeling of pulling on ripped tights stop
        reminding me of the first person i had sex with 
          
        is my mother’s struggle for english
        uglier than having monolids
          
        what if contemporary art
        tells the story of the immigrant
          
        why does remembering that i’m not white 
        make me feel like an ellipsis
          
        is showing someone your tongue and your teeth
        the same as asking for their respect 
          
        is speaking for my mother
        sweeter than the taste of my own blood
          
        is my body in the shape of
        the number of times i didn’t say no
          
        is loving my brother
        the same as wanting him to break someone’s heart  
          
        is it okay to imagine myself as a mother
        if i don’t know how to walk in stilettos  
          
        &
          
        how much pain must i suffer 
        to understand the color red
