          <p class="tab"><em> after Joe Brainard </em></p><p class="poetry">
I remember doing the buttons on my dress shirt for my first job  

I remember telling my father I loved him over and over during one car ride to school in the second grade
 
I remember crying at the thought that I would die at age one hundred and my brother trying to comfort me by telling me I still had ninety-four years left to live
 
I remember getting my first period in the worst smelling bathroom of my school and calling my mother calling my father who drove over and averted his eyes when handing me six pads hastily wrapped in a plastic bag
 
I remember wanting to become a translator between English, French, and Mandarin
 
I remember trying to choke down tornadoes of laughter in class, my eyes tearing up while my lips were shoved shut, smiling
 
I remember an auditorium of people clapping for my brother’s achievements and people coming up to me to praise him
 
I remember finishing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in the bathroom at two am because that was the only room with a locking door and my parents kept trying to turn off the light in my room
 
I remember tasting another girl’s saliva for the first time and having an epiphany. I remember that girls kiss better
 
I remember when classmates would tell me that Japanese, Korean, and Chinese were the same. I remember when we got to the age where we talked circles around race, no longer able to talk about it at all. 
 
I remember revisiting my childhood home, knocking on the door, and after an absence of an answer, pushing the unlocked door open. I remember seeing carpet where hardwood floor should have been
 
I remember packing boxes excitedly and packing boxes resentfully
 
I remember the weight of stars on my skin at an outdoor concert and feeling like my soul was held in the cupped hands of the music
 
I remember the eyelashes of the people I’ve kissed
 
I remember the warm skin of another body in my bed. I remember asking myself what I was doing with my hands
 
I remember wolf whistles thrown out windows, mixed with the exhaust of cars
 
I remember the vulnerability of wearing tights
 
I remember my father finding the bi flag I got at Pride and asking me which country it was for. I remember trying not to laugh or cry</p>
