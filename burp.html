          <h2> burp </h2>

          <p class="poetry">
everything happens by the water:
curly hair, sock marks, snow that you confuse 
for the moon. pink 
soles of bare feet
& oceanside grins. a tongue that is 
really a wave licking at
the humidity in humanity.
your hand reaching out to
the version of yourself that stands
in the ocean, dark water 
pulling at the bottoms 
of your jean pants, fingernails stuffed
with beads of sand. eyes, 
tell me that you are happy. nose,
scrunch up in joy. burp, laugh, sip.
inhale. let the water tell you
that it is yours.</p><br>
