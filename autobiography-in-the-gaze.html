the time is long after. 

i would like to watch the winged creatures leaping like a gazelle, so swift, so swift, in order to satisfy a Biblical narrative of angelic lightness and purity. as opposed to darkness. i would like to sleep to darkness. carefully.
            
everything unnoticed and unnecessary 
            
is done through the body. always there was some bleeding. i would like to watch you pick the silver branch, the wavering forest, the three moons. attention is the most common and purest form of generosity. there’s an autobiography in the gaze, in the sight.
            
i gazed on creation’s bed. 
            
i don’t want a border between angel and woman: so perfect so surreal. reach beyond the stars. i would like to sleep with the grief at the center of your dream. i turned myself into myself. i was jesus when i raised your hand, when i sowed diamonds in my back yard, and they stood with their backs to the dream. tell me why i am imperfection: the man’s rib.
