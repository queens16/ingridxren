          how much more of a woman do i become
          the first time i pull a trigger in a bodycon dress
          
          how long can we stay best friends
          until i forget my favorite color is our laugh
          
          when will the feeling of pulling on ripped tights stop
          reminding me of the first person i had sex with 
          
          is my mother’s struggle for english
          uglier than having monolids
          
          what if contemporary art
          tells the story of the immigrant
          
          why does remembering that i’m not white 
          make me feel like an ellipsis
          
          is showing someone your tongue and your teeth
          the same as asking for their respect 
          
          is speaking for my mother
          sweeter than the taste of my own blood
          
          is my body in the shape of
          the number of times i didn’t say no
          
          is loving my brother
          the same as wanting him to break someone’s heart  
          
          is it okay to imagine myself as a mother
          if i don’t know how to walk in stilettos  
          
          &
          
          how much pain must i suffer 
          to understand the color red
